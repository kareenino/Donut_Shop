## Donut Shop

DonutShop is a fun little Flutter app built to show off a stylish donut-themed UI with smooth animations and custom navigation. It was made as part of a Flutter codelab by Roman Jaquez, and it's packed with cool stuff like a swipeable donut carousel, a custom bottom nav bar, and a slick filtering bar to browse different types of donuts.

The app uses the provider package to manage state, and it’s a great starting point if you’re looking to learn how to structure a Flutter app cleanly with modular widgets and dynamic page routing.
